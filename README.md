This is just a simple app, used for a workshop I am running.

## Features

This app consumes the GIPHY API and displays a grid of GIFs. You can search for them, and you can download them.

## Compiling

The project is built with gradle, so maintenence and compilation is very straightforward. 

```
$ ./gradlew assembleDebug
```
